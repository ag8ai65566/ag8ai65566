# One-round claim-check review for GPT (template; Claude fills the {{…}} parts)

Why (author, 2026-10-01): raise the strength and accuracy of GPT's review. GPT runs at xhigh with live web
search, and the review is still one round, so it must be decisive and verifiable. The exported `## [SW]`
fields matter most, because they are what Sudowrite reads.

You are GPT, reviewing Claude's work for the novel-lab project "holoen", a Sudowrite Story Bible about
hololive members' public personas. This is the only review round. Write in English.

## Project rules that apply
{{rules}}

## What to do, in this order
1. **Claim check of the exported fields.** For every card below, go through each `## [SW]` field and list
   every factual claim (a date, event, song, stage, collab, pair name, quote, nickname, number). Check
   each one against a source you open. Prefer official pages and the primary stream or post. Use the
   dossier's source list first, then search. Give each claim one verdict:
   - `OK`: you opened a source that supports it. Give the URL.
   - `SECONDARY`: only a wiki, mirror or fan source supports it. Give the URL and say whether the card
     should label or soften it.
   - `UNSUPPORTED`: you could not find support. Say what you searched.
   - `WRONG`: a source contradicts it. Give the correct fact, the URL and the exact replacement wording.
   - `SCOPE`: it touches private life (health, family, breaks and their reasons, identity, nationality
     claims, auditions) or presents a performed bit as a real relationship. Give the replacement.
   List only the claims that are not `OK`, plus a count of the `OK` ones per card, so the review stays
   short. Do not skip a card.
2. **Quotation gate.** Every quoted spoken line on a card must be either official, a secondary
   transcription that is labeled as such, or an audio span that both ASR models agree on (the audio
   report lists each verdict). Flag any line that fails, with the fix.
3. **Voice teaching.** Compare Dialogue Style, Catchphrases, Voice & Delivery and Audio Tags with the
   Voice Profile and the audio report. Flag anything the evidence does not support, any measurement used
   as a synthesis target (mixed recordings are not isolated voices), any tag that would imitate a real
   person's voice, and anything that sexualizes a member. Say what is missing that Sudowrite needs to
   perform her (an accent feature, a laugh, a filler, a situation).
4. **Relationships.** Check that each tie is concrete and sourced, that group collabs name only the
   members who took part, that archive counts are not used as rankings, and that the same tie reads the
   same on both people's cards. Then list important ties that are missing, each with a source.
5. **Card usability.** Other Names that would trigger the card for the wrong character; duplicated
   content between fields; anything over the word limits.

## Output format
For each card: `## <card name>`, then `Claims: <n> OK.` and the non-OK claims as a table
`| Field | Claim (short) | Verdict | Source URL | Fix (exact wording) |`, then `MUST:` (numbered, each with the
fix) and `SHOULD:` (short). Then `## Cross-card consistency`, then `## Missing facts worth adding` (each
with a source you opened). End with `## Verification note`: what you could not open or check.
