# Sudowrite Style: audio-ready dialogue (ElevenLabs v4)

Paste the block below into Sudowrite's **Story Bible → Style** box (under the project's own style notes,
about 120 words; wording from GPT's 2026-10-01 review, adopted). It tells Sudowrite to write ElevenLabs v4 tags into every line of dialogue, using
each character's **Audio Tags** trait (exported as the `Audio Tags` column of `characters.csv`).

```text
Write dialogue for original designed voices, never to reproduce a member's identifiable voice. Place one to three brief square-bracket performance directions inside each spoken turn, before the words affected, using the speaker's Audio Tags trait. Change delivery only when the scene warrants it. Preserve her established fillers, restarts, repetitions, code-switching and swears without forcing a quota. Distinguish spoken interjections ([startled squawk] GWAK!) from nonverbal sounds ([laughs]); never render the same sound twice. Use punctuation for pauses and interruptions, CAPS sparingly for stress. Keep narration untagged. Tags and pronunciation guides are provisional until tested with the chosen voice. Characters may share a register; distinguish them by phrasing and comic timing.
```

## Notes
- Tags are performance directions for an **original** designed voice. Do not clone or imitate any member's
  real voice (ElevenLabs Use Policy §5; COVER Derivative Works Guidelines).
- Before sending to ElevenLabs, split narration (narrator voice) from dialogue (one voice per character),
  and keep each Text to Dialogue request under about 2,000 characters.
- If Sudowrite overuses tags, lower it to "one or two tags" in the Style text; if it drifts to generic
  tags ([happy], [sad]), add "Use only tags listed in the speaker's Audio Tags trait."
