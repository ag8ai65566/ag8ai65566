# QA resolution ledger (holoen)

Stable IDs for every finding the QA program raises, with Claude's disposition. Statuses: **applied** (in the
bible at the commit named), **pending** (accepted, not yet done; owner task named), **deferred** (moved to a
later task), **rejected** (reason given). Each applied fix is also recorded in the affected card's Merge Record.
Source of the CONSULT-* findings: `runs/20261001-1557-check-Project-Consult/gpt-free.md` (round 1) and
`runs/20261001-2050-check-Project-Consult-R2/gpt-free.md` (round 2).

| ID | Finding | Status | Where / commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| CONSULT-P0-001 | Pre-debut private history in exported cards (Bijou, Calli, Advent Pairs) | applied | 6a9212f |
| CONSULT-P0-002 | Private-life activity outside streams (FUWAMOCO, IRyS-and-Nerissa Pairs, Kiara, Nerissa) | applied | 6a9212f |
| CONSULT-P0-003 | Ina's private-routine example (sheet, card, audio report); a language-background claim (Kiara) | applied | 6a9212f |
| CONSULT-P0-004 | Paste sheet lacked the audio Style block | applied (exporter writes it first) | 6a9212f |
| CONSULT-P1-001 | History 2023–2026: Drawn to Dawn and Serendipity rows unzoned | applied (PDT) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P1-002 | Mumei / Fauna-and-Mumei: "R.E.P.O. with all of Promise" ambiguous | applied (IRyS, Kronii, Bae; archive F_EVW5Ig5QE) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P1-003 | OctoClock "Bad Apple"; Kobo's "BLUE CLAPPER" with Kronii and Nerissa | applied | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P1-004 | Official Serendipity units missing from Groups / world aliases | applied (Last Writes, Octo'clock, Rocku Wawa, BaeRyS, Bloodraven, B.F.F; Autofister already present) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P1-005 | 2026-09-07 restructuring relied on a wiki | applied (official announcement cited on "hololive") | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P1-006 | Kronii ASR report: "Agrees" rows that differ lexically | applied (Kronii rows rewritten by hand; all 151 other bare "Agrees" rows given computed shared spans by `tools/asr_spans.py`; 36 partial rows listed in `research/audio-check/partial-spans.md` for task 09) | this commit |
| CONSULT-P1-007 | Mococo: sparse solo evidence; speaker attribution | task 07 part applied: whole-channel archive search found no other attributable solo window (2026 "MOCOCO POV" is a multi-member role-play; 2024 candidates include her twin); attribution basis now stated separately in research/audio-check/fuwamoco.md; card and sheet say directions stay provisional. Quotation gate stays with task 09 | this commit |
| CONSULT-P1-008 | Performance sheets: settings scale; stale-sheet hashes | scale applied (UI % and API decimals); hashes pending (task 10 release builder) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-P2-001 | Myth sixth-anniversary live missing from shared timeline | applied as "announced, not verified as held" on Myth and TakaMori (only an announcement post is cited; no official event page or archive found by Claude 2026-10-01); propagation to History/Concerts waits for task 08 evidence | this commit |
| CONSULT-P2-002 | Audio Tags boilerplate before the distinguishing cue | deferred (task 09, all 18 cards at once) | — |
| CONSULT-P2-003 | Gura sheet "pre-2025 stories" excluded her active 2025 months | applied | snapshot commit |

| CONSULT-VAL-002 | Alias "hololive English first generation" on Myth and History to 2022 | applied (removed from History to 2022) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-X-001 | Calli's "B(+)" listed as a recurring emoticon | applied (removed; the context-poor post dropped) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-R2-001 | Incoming claims must include aliases, unit names, table rows and bullets | applied (`tools/qa_packets.py`) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-R2-002 | Packet inventory and SHA-256 map | applied (`research/qa/manifest.json`, packet headers) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-R2-003 | Registry: status intervals, event precision, directional credits, reference-only people | applied (registry v2; bounded, non-exhaustive) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-R2-004 | Promotion provenance outside `runs/` | applied (`research/qa/promotions.md`) | snapshot commit |
| CONSULT-R2-005 | Release candidate + acceptance tied to its manifest hash; finding priority ≠ validation severity | pending (task 10–11) | — |
